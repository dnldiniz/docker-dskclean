#         USAGE: ./docker-system-cleanup.sh [OPTIONS]
# 
#   DESCRIPTION: In its most simple form, this script will clean up exited 
#                containers, unused images and layers that have no relationship
#                to any tagged images (dangling).  It is also possible to extend
#                the cleaning to dangling volumes and maybe in some future release,
#                the user will be allowed to manually specify resources to be kept 
#                so all the rest can be pruned.

    USAGE:
        docker-dskclean [OPTIONS] 

    OPTIONS:
        -c - Check only. This will do a dry run and list all resources which would have been deleted if this flag was not passed.
        -D - Deep clean. Use this when you don't care about losing any data stored on the volumes.
            - Note: This will remove all volumes not currently associated with any container.
        -h - Display this help message and exit.
        -q - 'quiet', the clean-up process will go as silently as possible - most of the output will be redirected to the
            log file and only the most relevant info.
        -v - 'verbose', clean-up phase will output more textual information about what's being done.
	
    DESCRIPTION:
        In its most simple form, this script will clean up exited containers, unused images and layers that have no
        relationship to any tagged images (dangling).  It is also possible to extend the cleaning to dangling volumes and
        maybe in some future release, the user will be allowed to manually specify resources to be kept so all the rest
        can be pruned.
		NOTE: If you have exercised extreme caution with regard to irrevocable data loss, then you can delete unused (dangling) 
		volumes (v1.9 and up) by passing the -D (deep clean) flag.
